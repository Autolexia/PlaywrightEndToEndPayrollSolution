# PlaywrightEndToEndPayrollSolution

Assumptions: 
- A comprehensive automation solution is not required; the purposes of this assessment is to see my ability to automate tests and see the quality thereof
- No tests are required for the calculations as unit and integration tests exist to test this functionality in a much more appropriate way than using expensive UI tests
- No framework needs to be built taken the time constraints

Disclaimer:
- Many of the tests written in this project will be better suited for an integration and or unit test solution but will be written here for the purposes of demonstration
- No branching strategy was applied here given the context of the project and being the sole contributor, but this way of working is not recommended in a formal sitting
